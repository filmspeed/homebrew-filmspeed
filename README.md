# homebrew-filmtools

**CLI tools for analysing developed photo film Â· MacOS**



## Requirements

Make sure to have the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager for MacOS installed. The [installation instructions](https://brew.sh/) may look weird to first-timers, but it's really done in a minute. 

**Optional, but recommended:** Make this *homebrew-filmtools* *tap* and its included tools available to your local Homebrew ecosystem. Quoted from Homebrew docs: 
> `brew` will be able to work on those formulae as if they were in Homebrew's canonical repository. You can install and uninstall them with `brew [un]install`, and the formulae are automatically updated when you run brew update.

To install the tap, open your terminal and enter this command:

```bash
$ brew tap filmtools/filmtools
```



## Installation

To install all programs, open your terminal and type:


```bash
$ brew install filmcurve
```
